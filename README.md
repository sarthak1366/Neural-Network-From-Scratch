# Neural-Network-From-Scratch

In the first section we are trying to calculate the in put for just one neuronas given in diagram

Now as we move on to the second section we want to make the output layer , Now the calculation remains the same just the change is in here we are calculating for three outputs , and the ouput is provided in form of list rather than a singular output

Till section 3 what we did is just used the same thing over and over and changed the method of doing by a bit.<br>
In section 1 we calculated output for 1 neuron .<br>
In section 2 we calculated the output for a layer.<br>
In section 3 we just looped through each ouput neuron instead of hard coding for each neuron. <br>
