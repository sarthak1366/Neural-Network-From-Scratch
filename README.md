# Neural-Network-From-Scratch
<br>
In the first section we are trying to calculate the in put for just one neuronas given in diagram<br>

Now as we move on to the second section we want to make the output layer , Now the calculation remains the same just the change is in here we are calculating for three outputs , and the ouput is provided in form of list rather than a singular output

Till section 3 what we did is just used the same thing over and over and changed the method of doing by a bit.<br>
In section 1 we calculated output for 1 neuron .<br>
In section 2 we calculated the output for a layer.<br>
In section 3 we just looped through each ouput neuron instead of hard coding for each neuron. <br>

Now in section 6 , what we try to do is give input in batches. Earlier we were providing a single input , now according to this input we were getting the output.
Let us consider a problem of linear regression to be solved by neural network. If we give single single input in each iteration the neural network need to fit the line according to new input.
